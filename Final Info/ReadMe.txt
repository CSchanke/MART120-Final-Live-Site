This is the final version of my final project - Slay the Circles!
One feature listed in the proposal was changed to a similar feature that was far more practical to implement. As the circles
no longer have HP values, the weapons now all deal the same damage. In order to compensate, I have given larger  and slower weapons
a small area of effect which makes them easier to hit with. I made a separate repository for this since I was still having
trouble with GitHub pages from week 8 in my original repo. Site should work fine, but if it doesn't please let me know.
